# Surface_reconstruction
In this project i have made a graphical user interface (GUI) using OPen3D gui library. Here i capture a point cloud using intel realsense camera D435 and then provide surface reconstruction algorithms given by Open3D module. The features provided in the GUI are from Open3D library. It is an opensource library for 3D data processing.
The features are such as
* Downsample point cloud
* Surface reconstruction of the point cloud, using
  * Alpha shapes
  * Ball pivoting
  * Poisson reconstruction algorithm


The GUI is set with default values for best reconstruction results. But the user may tune the variable according to their needs.
